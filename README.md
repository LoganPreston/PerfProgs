# PerfProgs
Currently program to review performance of strcat in C (O(N^2)) compared to a modified version (O(N)) from https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/12/11/back-to-basics/
Create CSV from C and graph in python. Python script has logarithmic vertical axis to display data. ~16 concatenations is where they begin to diverge. Also somewhat interesting - 4096 concatenations takes less time than 2048.
